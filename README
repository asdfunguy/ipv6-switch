I wrote this script due to my computer directly connecting to domains
via IPv6 while running an OpenVPN session. Obviously, if I wanted to 
directly connect to said websites, I wouldn't be running the afore-
mentioned VPN session.

This script lists out the current network interfaces, and allows the
user to choose which to disable/enable by typing the number adjacent to
the interface into the input area, then pressing the return key.
